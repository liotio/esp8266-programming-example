Note: Both, the NodeMCU firmware and the NodeMCU devkit, are using a different pin mapping!
Thus, if you connected something to ESP8266EX pin 2 for example, you have to use 4 for pin "D4" in your program.
Vice versa, if you are using the NodeMCU devkit and want to use another programming option as the NodeMCU firmware,
this means that pin "D4" can be addressed by using 2 in your program.
